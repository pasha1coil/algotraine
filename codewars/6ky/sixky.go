// Write a function toWeirdCase (weirdcase in Ruby) that accepts a string, and returns the same string with all even indexed characters in each word upper cased, and all odd indexed characters in each word lower cased. The indexing just explained is zero based, so the zero-ith index is even, therefore that character should be upper cased and you need to start over for each word.

// The passed in string will only consist of alphabetical characters and spaces(' '). Spaces will only be present if there are multiple words. Words will be separated by a single space(' ').

// Examples:
// toWeirdCase("String") // => returns "StRiNg"
// toWeirdCase("Weird string case") // => returns "WeIrD StRiNg CaSe"

// Two tortoises named A and B must run a race. A starts with an average speed of 720 feet per hour. Young B knows she runs faster than A, and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

// When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B's speed is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take B to catch A?

// More generally: given two speeds v1 (A's speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B's speed, integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?

// The result will be an array [hour, min, sec] which is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds (round down to the nearest second) or a string in some languages.

// If v1 >= v2 then return nil, nothing, null, None or {-1, -1, -1} for C++, C, Go, Nim, Pascal, COBOL, Erlang, [-1, -1, -1] for Perl,[] for Kotlin or "-1 -1 -1" for others.

// Examples:
// (form of the result depends on the language)

// race(720, 850, 70) => [0, 32, 18] or "0 32 18"
// race(80, 91, 37)   => [3, 21, 49] or "3 21 49"
// Note:
// See other examples in "Your test cases".

// In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use dynamically allocated character strings.

// ** Hints for people who don't know how to convert to hours, minutes, seconds:

// Tortoises don't care about fractions of seconds
// Think of calculation by hand using only integers (in your code use or simulate integer division)
// or Google: "convert decimal time to hours minutes seconds"

// Let us begin with an example:

// A man has a rather old car being worth $2000. He saw a secondhand car being worth $8000. He wants to keep his old car until he can buy the secondhand one.

// He thinks he can save $1000 each month but the prices of his old car and of the new one decrease of 1.5 percent per month. Furthermore this percent of loss increases of 0.5 percent at the end of every two months. Our man finds it difficult to make all these calculations.

// Can you help him?

// How many months will it take him to save up enough money to buy the car he wants, and how much money will he have left over?

// Parameters and return of function:

// parameter (positive int or float, guaranteed) start_price_old (Old car price)
// parameter (positive int or float, guaranteed) start_price_new (New car price)
// parameter (positive int or float, guaranteed) saving_per_month
// parameter (positive float or int, guaranteed) percent_loss_by_month

// nbMonths(2000, 8000, 1000, 1.5) should return [6, 766] or (6, 766)
// Detail of the above example:
// end month 1: percent_loss 1.5 available -4910.0
// end month 2: percent_loss 2.0 available -3791.7999...
// end month 3: percent_loss 2.0 available -2675.964
// end month 4: percent_loss 2.5 available -1534.06489...
// end month 5: percent_loss 2.5 available -395.71327...
// end month 6: percent_loss 3.0 available 766.158120825...
// return [6, 766] or (6, 766)
// where 6 is the number of months at the end of which he can buy the new car and 766 is the nearest integer to 766.158... (rounding 766.158 gives 766).

// Note:

// Selling, buying and saving are normally done at end of month. Calculations are processed at the end of each considered month but if, by chance from the start, the value of the old car is bigger than the value of the new one or equal there is no saving to be made, no need to wait so he can at the beginning of the month buy the new car:

// nbMonths(12000, 8000, 1000, 1.5) should return [0, 4000]
// nbMonths(8000, 8000, 1000, 1.5) should return [0, 0]

	priceNew := float64(startPriceNew)
